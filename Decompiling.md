# Decompiling (TO DO)
### Reruired programs
- [uTinyRipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/utinyripper/files/)
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) (not sure about that if you can still use the same version mentioned above in the [modding audio section (2019.3.12)](#required-programs), or use the the [2018.1.1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whatsnew/unity-2018.1.1) version)
### How to decompile the game?
- To decompile the game, just drag the folder with your Baldi's Basics Classic to uTinyRipper. After that, choose/make a fodler where you'll store the decompiled game.
- To check how the decompiled game looks like, open Unity Hub, add a new unity Project and select the folder with the decompiled game and open it. Opening it is gonna take a while...
- When the project is Open, click on the Scene folder and click the scene you want to see.
- If the school (or any scene you want to laod) is displayed on Unity, it means it works and you're kinda ready to make a decompile mod.

### Building (TO WRITE)
